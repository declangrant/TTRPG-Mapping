# TTRPG-Mapping

This project provides a 3D interactive map for various tabletop roleplaying games, built with [ESRI's ArcGIS SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/).
The maps here are used by myself and my group.
If you stumbled upon this repository from the internet at large, you probably don't have a use for this.
